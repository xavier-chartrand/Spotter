Routine to analyse surface displacements measured by Sofar Ocean Spotter buoys.
NetCDF files for different level of processing are generated :

    lvl0: displacements remapped to a regularly spaced 2.5Hz grid, and
          controled for quality
    lvl1: wave bulk parameters computed from 30-minutes records of lvl0 data,
          and controled for quality
